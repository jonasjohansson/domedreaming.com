      <h1>DOME DREAMING</h1>
      <p>
        DOME DREAMING is an interdisciplinary festival divided between Wisdome Stockholm and Malmö, two newly built state-of-the-art domes.
        Featuring fulldome visuals and ambisonic sound, it showcases narrative films, live performances, and interactive installations. The
        festival explores the potential of the dome format through Nordic-Baltic collaboration, a curated screening programme, artist
        residencies and student participation.

        <h2>THE WISDOME PROJECT</h2>
        <p>
          Wisdome connects science centers, universities, and research institutions to explore new ways of engaging audiences through
          audiovisual production. Rooted in research from Linköping University and Visualiseringscenter C, it focuses on sparking curiosity
          in science and technology, especially among youth.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2022–2023, as part of the Wisdome project, Tekniska Museet and Malmö Museer introduced cutting-edge dome theaters with
          180-degree visuals and ambisonic sound. These domes host everything from complex simulations to experimental performances.
        </p>
        <p>
          While Wisdome centers on scientific visualisation, its potential goes further. Dome theaters, explored by artists and filmmakers
          worldwide, are now a platform for artistic expression in Sweden. This opens the door for cross-disciplinary collaboration and a
          creative community waiting to be let in.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2024, Stockholm and Malmö launched open calls, inviting musicians, actors, programmers, motion designers, and filmmakers to
          create new works in new ways.

        <h2>THE DOME DREAMING ETHOS</h2>
        <p>
          DOME DREAMING draws from Expanded Cinema, Visions of the Present, and Black Mountain College—three movements that redefined
          artistic and technological boundaries. Expanded Cinema (1960s) moved film beyond the screen, adopting non-linear narratives and
          experimental formats. Visions of the Present (1966, Stockholm) combined art, technology, and media to challenge audience
          engagement. Black Mountain College integrated art, science, and performance, influencing works like Stan VanDerBeek's Movie-Drome
          and Billy Klüver's Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), which connected artists with engineers.
        </p>
        <p>
          DOME DREAMING adapts these radical ideas to the dome format. It transforms cinema from a passive experience into an immersive
          180-degree space where storytelling, sound, and visuals converge. Hosted at Wisdome Stockholm and Wisdome Malmö, the festival
          encourages collaboration, experimentation, and cross-disciplinary innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite Sweden's five Wisdome domes, funding and recognition for experimental film and dome content remain scarce—especially
          beyond science and education. DOME DREAMING is here to change that.

        <h2>NORDIC AUDIOVISUAL ARTISTS</h2>
        <p>
          NAVA (Nordic Audiovisual Artists) was founded in 2016 by Jonas Johansson (SE), Rasmus Stride (DK), Owen Hindley (UK) and Atli
          Bollason (IS) during a collective project at Harpa, Reykjavik. In 2017, NAVA gained recognition with projects like Light Organ and
          Tiny/Massive at Sónar, pairing musicians and visual artists via open calls. By 2019, NAVA expanded beyond Iceland, hosting the
          event Skaðablót and continuing work across the Nordic region.
        </p>
        <p>
          NAVA, now mostly led by Jonas, partnered with Aavistus festival in Helsinki. In 2021, artist Annie Tådne co-founded Nonagon in
          Sweden. The network grew with collaborations like Nordic Lights, and in 2023 Jonas, Annie, and Merle performed at Arctic Sounds in
          Greenland, connecting with local talent. In 2024 Jonas and NAVA connected with Kokong in Åland and Baltic Analog Lab in Latvia.
          The network thrives on experience exchange, strengthening the community's ability to create exceptional audiovisual work.

        <h2>BEYOND WISDOME</h2>
        <p>
          Domes have long served as a canvas for artistic exploration and collaboration. In the 1960s, Steve VanDerBeek created
          Movie-Drome—a pioneering prototype for networked image communication ("CULTURE: Intercom"), made as a collaborative tool long
          before the Internet. Buckminster Fuller, too, reimagined the potential of domes, using them as structures to unite artistic
          disciplines and push the boundaries of architecture.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 1996, La SAT in Montreal has been a beacon for dome innovation, fostering a vibrant creative community that has grown in
          part due to the success of Cirque du Soleil. Each week they invite musicians and visual artists, opening up the dome. Other
          notable initiatives, such as Visions of the Now (2015–2017) by Anna Lundh, The New Infinity in Berlin (2018–2021), and the Lumen
          Project (2019–2024) in Eric Ericssonhallen, have further expanded the scope of immersive experiences.
        </p>
        <p>
          DOME DREAMING draws inspiration from these pioneering efforts, but with an eye toward forging new paths. By pushing the limits of
          immersive media, we aim to explore the unique, transformative potential of the dome while creating our own distinct contributions
          to this evolving field.

        <h2>A HISTORY OF AUDIOVISUAL ART</h2>
        <p>
          The history of audiovisual art is driven by a desire to break down the barriers between seeing and hearing—to give sound a visual
          form and let images carry sound. From early experiments in visual music to today's dome-based media, artists have tried to create
          multisensory experiences that go beyond the limits of each sense.
        </p>
        <p>
          This began strongly in the 1920s with artists like Viking Eggeling and Hans Richter. They created abstract films based on rhythm
          and visual structure. Eggeling's Symphonie Diagonale (1924) moved like a musical score, with shapes unfolding over time. These
          works were built on the idea that visual elements—lines, shapes, and contrasts—could be arranged like music to show patterns of
          movement and emotion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Artists Walter Ruttmann and Oskar Fischinger, took these ideas further. Fischinger's animations came before electronic
          synthesisers, but still gave a strong sense of musical structure. In An Optical Poem (1938), he used cut-paper animation set to
          music by Franz Liszt, creating floating shapes that felt both abstract and emotional. In the US, Mary Ellen Bute helped bring
          these experiments to a wider audience. She used both hand-drawn techniques and early electronic tools to explore rhythm and image.
          She was among the first to describe her work as "seeing sound," and helped shape the growing field of visual music.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea of turning music into colour—or colour into music—has fascinated artists for centuries. In the 18th century, inventors
          built "colour organs" to project light in response to sound. In 1896, Swedish inventor Martin Wiberg created the Spektralpiano,
          which used coloured glass and light to replace sound with colour. He imagined full performances of "colour symphonies" that aimed
          to stir emotions through light alone. His invention came before the better-known colour pianos of Alexander Scriabin and others,
          and paved the way for later instruments.
        </p>
        <p>
          No one captured this mix of image and sound more clearly than John Whitney. With training in both music and design, he used
          analogue computers, originally built for missile guidance—to create animations driven by maths and music. His film Catalog (1961)
          showed how programming could become a kind of composition, where colour, movement, and pattern worked like musical elements.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the UK, Daphne Oram developed the Oramics system in the 1950s. She drew shapes directly onto film to produce sound, turning
          gesture into sound waves. Like Whitney, she believed in a combined language of sound and image.
        </p>
        <p>
          By the 1960s and '70s, artists began exploring how these ideas could shape physical space. Nam June Paik, using custom-built video
          tools, created live performances and multi-screen setups that broke the rules of passive media. His work was lively, strange, and
          full of energy—bringing together sound, image, and body. At the same time, Stan VanDerBeek built the Movie-Drome, a dome-shaped
          theatre for immersive film. Visitors lay beneath a flow of moving images from news, art, and science. It was not just about
          watching, but about stepping into a new kind of space and experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          These projects were part of a wider movement called expanded cinema—a term by Gene Youngblood for artworks that moved beyond film
          into performance, installation, and mixed media. Paik was a key figure in this shift. Others, like Anthony McCall and the USCO
          collective, used light and sound to shape space. At Bell Labs, Lillian Schwartz worked with scientists to make images using early
          computers, bringing coding into art for the first time. Later, artists like Steina and Woody Vasulka used video signals, noise,
          and feedback as creative tools, exploring new ways of working with electronic images and sound.
        </p>
        <p>
          What links all these artists is their interest in the senses. They didn't just want to make films or music—they wanted to create
          full, physical experiences. Their work explored how we see, hear, and move inside a space. Today, artists continue this path in
          domes, multi-projector spaces, and algorithmic environments. They search for new ways to bring vision and sound together—not just
          side by side, but as one shared experience. DOME DREAMING aims at being a modern focal point for this development and shared
          dreaming within the extended nordic region. Onwards and upwards.

        <h2>STATE OF THE DOME</h2>
        <p>
          Over the past two decades, the dome has transformed from a tool of celestial education to a platform for artistic exploration.
          Originally built to simulate the night sky, fulldome spaces have become canvases for experimental visuals, immersive storytelling,
          and multi-sensory performance. Yet, despite the medium's evolution and global momentum, the cultural potential of domes remains
          vastly underexplored. Particularly outside of science programming and within the Nordic-Baltic region.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2023, Fulldome in the UK, a comprehensive sector report produced by Live Cinema UK and funded by Creative UK, outlined a
          landscape of possibility tempered by structural challenges. The report affirmed what many fulldome artists and curators have long
          known: that fulldome is a rich, unique medium, but one that remains fragmented and under-resourced. In particular, it highlighted
          an urgent need for funding mechanisms, standardised production templates, cross-venue programming, curated archives, and
          accessible production pipelines.
        </p>
        <p>
          DOME DREAMING responds directly to these calls. As an ambitious two-week Nordic-Baltic festival unfolding across Wisdome Stockholm
          and Wisdome Malmö, DOME DREAMING was designed as a timely intervention: an answer to the sector's gaps, and a model for what a
          sustainable, artist-centred fulldome ecosystem might look like.
        </p>
        <p>
          This report begins with the "State of the Dome" to reflect on the findings from the UK study and reframe them through our local
          context. We use its key observations as a structure to illuminate what is missing—and how DOME DREAMING proposes to address it.
        </p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 300; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px">
          1. Challenge: A lack of cultural fulldome content visibility and programming routes
        </h3>
        <p>
          The UK report notes that while artistic fulldome content exists, much of it remains "invisible"—either scattered across small
          festivals or unpublished due to a lack of confidence, context, or support. There is no shared platform or archive where work is
          properly documented or discoverable.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Response:</strong> DOME DREAMING features an artist residency and curated programme, accompanied by the creation of a
          digital replica of the dome for online viewing. This not only extends access but also builds a de facto archive of contemporary
          fulldome works from across the Nordic and Baltic regions. Our inclusion of student works also ensures that emerging voices are
          given the space to be seen.
        </p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 300; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px">
          2. Challenge: Fragmented technical standards and difficult production workflows
        </h3>
        <p>
          Every dome is different—size, projection system, audio setup, seating arrangement. These variations impose costly barriers on
          artists, who must often reformat content for each venue, discouraging experimentation.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Response:</strong> DOME DREAMING provides an open-source "Creators Toolkit," developed during Wisdome hackathons, to
          support streamlined dome production across tools like Blender, TouchDesigner, Cinema4D and AfterEffects. The toolkit includes
          templates, projection guides, best practices, and workflow documentation aimed at future-proofing content and lowering entry
          thresholds.
        </p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 300; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px">
          3. Challenge: The absence of curated experiences for short-form works
        </h3>
        <p>
          While planetariums often rely on long-format science films, the majority of cultural dome work is created by individual artists,
          often as short-form or experimental pieces. Without curation, these works struggle to find audiences or funding.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Response:</strong> Our curated programme brings together short works—animated, live-action, and experimental—into
          thematically resonant screenings. This model mirrors the approach of film festivals and arthouse cinemas, making the dome an
          accessible venue for complex and varied experiences.
        </p>

        <h3 style="font-size: 14px; font-weight: 300; margin-top: 30px; margin-bottom: 10px">
          4. Challenge: Fulldome work is often siloed from other creative disciplines
        </h3>
        <p>
          The report notes that while many XR, music, and performance artists are interested in fulldome, there are few structures in place
          to bring them in. Fulldome remains a "walled garden," inaccessible without significant technical or institutional support.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Response:</strong> Inspired by the cross-disciplinary legacy of Expanded Cinema and Experiments in Art and Technology,
          DOME DREAMING brings together visual artists, composers, XR developers, filmmakers, designers, and performers. Our advisors and
          collaborators span multiple disciplines, ensuring that the dome is not only a canvas, but a site of convergence.
        </p>

        <p style="margin-top: 30px">
          In short, DOME DREAMING is both an artistic statement and a sectoral prototype. It draws on the findings of the UK report not just
          to describe what is missing, but to demonstrate what is possible. Through strategic collaborations, curated programming,
          infrastructure development, and community building, it aims to catalyse a vibrant and sustainable dome culture across the
          Nordic-Baltic region—where the fulldome is not a niche, but a new frontier. Read the fulldome report here.
