          <h2>THE WISDOME PROJECT</h2>
          <p>
            Wisdome connects science centers, universities, and research institutions to explore new ways of engaging audiences through
            audiovisual production. Rooted in research from Linköping University and Visualiseringscenter C, it focuses on sparking
            curiosity in science and technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2022–2023, as part of the Wisdome project, Tekniska Museet and Malmö Museer introduced cutting-edge dome theaters with
            180-degree visuals and ambisonic sound. These domes host everything from complex simulations to experimental performances.
          </p>
          <p>
            While Wisdome centers on scientific visualisation, its potential goes further. Dome theaters, explored by artists and filmmakers
            worldwide, are now a platform for artistic expression in Sweden. This opens the door for cross-disciplinary collaboration and a
            creative community waiting to be let in.

          <h2>THE DOME DREAMING ETHOS</h2>
          <p>
            DOME DREAMING draws from Expanded Cinema, Visions of the Present, and Black Mountain College—three movements that redefined
            artistic and technological boundaries. Expanded Cinema (1960s) moved film beyond the screen, adopting non-linear narratives and
            experimental formats. Visions of the Present (1966, Stockholm) combined art, technology, and media to challenge audience
            engagement. Black Mountain College integrated art, science, and performance, influencing works like Stan VanDerBeek's
            Movie-Drome and Billy Klüver's Experiments in Art and Technology (E.A.T.), which connected artists with engineers.
          </p>
          <p>
            DOME DREAMING adapts these radical ideas to the dome format. It transforms cinema from a passive experience into an immersive
            180-degree space where storytelling, sound, and visuals converge. Hosted at Wisdome Stockholm and Wisdome Malmö, the festival
            encourages collaboration, experimentation, and cross-disciplinary innovation.
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite Sweden's five Wisdome domes, funding and recognition for experimental film and dome content remain scarce—especially
            beyond science and education. DOME DREAMING aims at changing that.

          <h2>BEYOND WISDOME</h2>
          <p>
            Domes have long served as a canvas for artistic exploration and collaboration. In the 1960s, Steve VanDerBeek created
            Movie-Drome—a pioneering prototype for networked image communication ("CULTURE: Intercom"), made as a collaborative tool long
            before the Internet. Buckminster Fuller, too, reimagined the potential of domes, using them as structures to unite artistic
            disciplines and push the boundaries of architecture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 1996, La SAT in Montreal has been a beacon for dome innovation, fostering a vibrant creative community that has grown in
            part due to the success of Cirque du Soleil. Each week they invite musicians and visual artists, opening up the dome. Other
            notable initiatives, such as Visions of the Now (2015–2017) by Anna Lundh, The New Infinity in Berlin (2018–2021), and the Lumen
            Project (2019–2024) in Eric Ericssonhallen, have further expanded the scope of immersive experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            DOME DREAMING draws inspiration from these pioneering efforts, but with an eye toward forging new paths. By pushing the limits
            of immersive media, we aim to explore the unique, transformative potential of the dome while creating our own distinct
            contributions to this evolving field.

          <h2>A HISTORY OF AUDIOVISUAL ART</h2>
          <p>
            The history of audiovisual art is driven by a desire to break down the barriers between seeing and hearing—to give sound a
            visual form and let images carry sound. From early experiments in visual music to today's dome-based media, artists have tried
            to create multisensory experiences that go beyond the limits of each sense.
          </p>
          <p>
            This began strongly in the 1920s with artists like Viking Eggeling and Hans Richter. They created abstract films based on rhythm
            and visual structure. Eggeling's Symphonie Diagonale (1924) moved like a musical score, with shapes unfolding over time. These
            works were built on the idea that visual elements—lines, shapes, and contrasts—could be arranged like music to show patterns of
            movement and emotion.
          </p>
          <p>
            Artists Walter Ruttmann and Oskar Fischinger, took these ideas further. Fischinger's animations came before electronic
            synthesisers, but still gave a strong sense of musical structure. In An Optical Poem (1938), he used cut-paper animation set to
            music by Franz Liszt, creating floating shapes that felt both abstract and emotional. In the US, Mary Ellen Bute helped bring
            these experiments to a wider audience. She used both hand-drawn techniques and early electronic tools to explore rhythm and
            image. She was among the first to describe her work as "seeing sound," and helped shape the growing field of visual music.
          </p>
          <p>
            The idea of turning music into colour—or colour into music—has fascinated artists for centuries. In the 18th century, inventors
            built "colour organs" to project light in response to sound. In 1896, Swedish inventor Martin Wiberg created the Spektralpiano,
            which used coloured glass and light to replace sound with colour. He imagined full performances of "colour symphonies" that
            aimed to stir emotions through light alone. His invention came before the better-known colour pianos of Alexander Scriabin and
            others, and paved the way for later instruments.
          </p>
          <p>
            No one captured this mix of image and sound more clearly than John Whitney. With training in both music and design, he used
            analogue computers, originally built for missile guidance—to create animations driven by maths and music. His film Catalog
            (1961) showed how programming could become a kind of composition, where colour, movement, and pattern worked like musical
            elements.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the UK, Daphne Oram developed the Oramics system in the 1950s. She drew shapes directly onto film to produce sound, turning
            gesture into sound waves. Like Whitney, she believed in a combined language of sound and image.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the 1960s and '70s, artists began exploring how these ideas could shape physical space. Nam June Paik, using custom-built
            video tools, created live performances and multi-screen setups that broke the rules of passive media. His work was lively,
            strange, and full of energy—bringing together sound, image, and body. At the same time, Stan VanDerBeek built the Movie-Drome, a
            dome-shaped theatre for immersive film. Visitors lay beneath a flow of moving images from news, art, and science. It was not
            just about watching, but about stepping into a new kind of space and experience.
          </p>
          <p>
            These projects were part of a wider movement called expanded cinema—a term by Gene Youngblood for artworks that moved beyond
            film into performance, installation, and mixed media. Paik was a key figure in this shift. Others, like Anthony McCall and the
            USCO collective, used light and sound to shape space. At Bell Labs, Lillian Schwartz worked with scientists to make images using
            early computers, bringing coding into art for the first time. Later, artists like Steina and Woody Vasulka used video signals,
            noise, and feedback as creative tools, exploring new ways of working with electronic images and sound.
          </p>
          <p>
            What links all these artists is their interest in the senses. They didn't just want to make films or music—they wanted to create
            full, physical experiences. Their work explored how we see, hear, and move inside a space. Today, artists continue this path in
            domes, multi-projector spaces, and algorithmic environments. They search for new ways to bring vision and sound together—not
            just side by side, but as one shared experience. DOME DREAMING aims at being a modern focal point for this development and
            shared dreaming within the extended nordic region. Onwards and upwards.

          <h2>STATE OF THE DOME</h2>
          <p>
            Over the past two decades, the dome has transformed from a tool of celestial education to a platform for artistic exploration.
            Originally built to simulate the night sky, fulldome spaces have become canvases for experimental visuals, immersive
            storytelling, and multi-sensory performance. Yet, despite the medium's evolution and global momentum, the cultural potential of
            domes remains vastly underexplored. Particularly outside of science programming and within the Nordic-Baltic region.
          </p>
          <p>
            In 2023, Fulldome in the UK, a comprehensive sector report produced by Live Cinema UK and funded by Creative UK, outlined a
            landscape of possibility tempered by structural challenges. The report affirmed what many fulldome artists and curators have
            long known: that fulldome is a rich, unique medium, but one that remains fragmented and under-resourced. In particular, it
            highlighted an urgent need for funding mechanisms, standardised production templates, cross-venue programming, curated archives,
            and accessible production pipelines.
          </p>
          <p>
            DOME DREAMING responds directly to these calls. As an ambitious festival unfolding across Wisdome Stockholm and Wisdome Malmö,
            DOME DREAMING was designed as a timely intervention: an answer to the sector's gaps, and a model for what a sustainable,
            artist-centred fulldome ecosystem might look like.
          </p>
          <p>
            This report begins with the "State of the Dome" to reflect on the findings from the UK study and reframe them through our local
            context. We use its key observations as a structure to illuminate what is missing—and how DOME DREAMING proposes to address it.
          </p>

          <h3 class="challenge-title">1. Challenge: A lack of cultural fulldome content visibility and programming routes</h3>
          <p>
            The UK report notes that while artistic fulldome content exists, much of it remains "invisible"—either scattered across small
            festivals or unpublished due to a lack of confidence, context, or support. There is no shared platform or archive where work is
            properly documented or discoverable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Response:</strong> DOME DREAMING features an open call (and hopefully in the future, artist residencies) and curated
            programme, accompanied by the creation of a digital replica of the dome for online viewing. This not only extends access but
            also builds a de facto archive of contemporary fulldome works from across the Nordic and Baltic regions. Our inclusion of
            student works also ensures that emerging voices are given the space to be seen.
          </p>

          <h3 class="challenge-title">2. Challenge: Fragmented technical standards and difficult production workflows</h3>
          <p>
            Every dome is different—size, projection system, audio setup, seating arrangement. These variations impose costly barriers on
            artists, who must often reformat content for each venue, discouraging experimentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Response:</strong> DOME DREAMING provides an open-source "Creators Toolkit," developed during Wisdome hackathons, to
            support streamlined dome production across tools like Blender, TouchDesigner, Cinema4D and AfterEffects. The toolkit includes
            templates, projection guides, best practices, and workflow documentation aimed at future-proofing content and lowering entry
            thresholds.
          </p>

          <h3 class="challenge-title">3. Challenge: The absence of curated experiences for short-form works</h3>
          <p>
            While planetariums often rely on long-format science films, the majority of cultural dome work is created by individual artists,
            often as short-form or experimental pieces. Without curation, these works struggle to find audiences or funding.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Response:</strong> Our curated programme brings together short works—animated, live-action, and experimental—into
            thematically resonant screenings. This model mirrors the approach of film festivals and arthouse cinemas, making the dome an
            accessible venue for complex and varied experiences.
          </p>

          <h3 class="challenge-title">4. Challenge: Fulldome work is often siloed from other creative disciplines</h3>
          <p>
            The report notes that while many XR, music, and performance artists are interested in fulldome, there are few structures in
            place to bring them in. Fulldome remains a "walled garden," inaccessible without significant technical or institutional support.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Response:</strong> Inspired by the cross-disciplinary legacy of Expanded Cinema and Experiments in Art and Technology,
            DOME DREAMING brings together visual artists, composers, XR developers, filmmakers, designers, and performers. Our advisors and
            collaborators span multiple disciplines, ensuring that the dome is not only a canvas, but a site of convergence.
          </p>

          <p class="section-footer">
            In short, DOME DREAMING is both an artistic statement and a sectoral prototype. It draws on the findings of the UK report not
            just to describe what is missing, but to demonstrate what is possible. Through strategic collaborations, curated programming,
            infrastructure development, and community building, it aims to catalyse a vibrant and sustainable dome culture across the
            Nordic-Baltic region—where the fulldome is not a niche, but a new frontier. Read the fulldome report here.
