# Vite Build Setup

This project now uses Vite for development and production builds.

## Installation

Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Development

Start the development server with live reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The site will be available at `http://localhost:3000` with hot module replacement (HMR) - changes will reload automatically.

## Production Build

Build for production (minified JS and CSS):
```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` folder with:
- Minified JavaScript files (with content hashes)
- Minified CSS files (with content hashes)
- Static assets (fonts, images, models) copied as-is

## Preview Production Build

Preview the production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

**Note:** Preview mode serves static files and does NOT have live reload. For development with live reload, use `npm run dev`.

To watch for changes and auto-rebuild (then manually refresh browser):
```bash
npm run build:watch
```

## Build Output

- **JavaScript**: Minified with Terser, output to `dist/assets/js/`
- **CSS**: Minified, output to `dist/assets/css/`
- **Static Assets**: Copied to `dist/assets/` (fonts, images, models, media)
- **HTML**: Processed and output to `dist/`

## Notes

- Console logs are preserved in production builds (can be changed in `vite.config.js`)
- Source maps are not generated by default (can be enabled in config)
- All assets maintain their directory structure
